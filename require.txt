Part 1: Get the property information.

Here is the sample url, that we will be using.
https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/236-Acadia-Ter-Celebration-FL-34747/69314172_zpid/

I need you to build a scrapper that will go to a listing on Zillow and grab the following:

- Download all photos and video in the largest size
- Listing Price//
- Address//
- Bedrooms//
- Bathrooms//
- Sqft//
- Year Built//
- Lot size//
- Description//
- Listing provided by information
- MLS#//
- All Facts & Features//
- All Property information //
- Grab the breadcrumb navigation ie Florida • Osceola County • Kissimmee • 34747 • North Village

I need you to save this information into a mysql database using the MLS# as a unique key and save the images to a specific folder on the server.

This need to run on a basic digital ocean droplet
